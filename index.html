        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my first page. I am an aspiring cybersecurity unicorn. This little project is just to help me get more familiar with HTML syntax. I am also on a mission to learn and understand CSS, Python, Assembly Language, among other things. Also, this site is to tell the world about myself a bit through my travels and blogs. Hopefully this page will develop into more than just HTML over time. Enjoy!!</p>

        <h2 id="fam">Family</h2>
            <p>My family is my foundation. They support me, believe in me, keep me grounded, roast me when necessary, and love me unconditionally. Without my family I would not be the person I am today. Shout-out to Mom, Dad, Charles, Chavon, Kelli, Tammy, Einola and everyone else. I am beyond blessed to have been put on this Earth with you as my biological family.</p>

        <h2 id="frat">Fraternity</h2>
            <p>When in college, me and 5 other individuals started a new Chapter of a fraternity. Pledging with <a href="https://phideltapsifraternity.org/" target="_blank">Phi Delta Psi Fraternity Inc</a> tested me in many ways, but what I truly cherish about it is it gave me the confidence to be comfortable with myself around people that look like me who are not in my biological family.</p>
            <p>Our motto: "All that we put into the lives of others comes back into our own."</p>

            <p>I attended <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a> in Long Island, New York from 2011-2016. I had a full college experience, learning a lot about myself while making some lifelong friends as well. This is also where I discovered my passion for rugby. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Multidisciplinary Studies, concentrating on Philosophy, History, and Sociology.</p>
