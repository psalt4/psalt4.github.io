        <h3>Philip Salter</h3>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my first page. I am an aspiring cybersecurity unicorn. This little project is just to help me get more familiar with HTML syntax. I am also on a mission to learn and understand CSS, Python, Assembly Language, among other things. Also, this site is to tell the world about myself a bit through my travels and blogs. Hopefully this page will develop into more than just HTML over time. Enjoy!!</p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>My family is my foundation. They support me, believe in me, keep me grounded, roast me when necessary, and love me unconditionally. Without my family I would not be the person I am today. Shout-out to Mom, Dad, Charles, Chavon, Kelli, Tammy, Einola and everyone else. I am beyond blessed to have been put on this Earth with you as my biological family.</p>
        <h2>Rugby</h2>
            <p>Rugby is life. Since I started playing rugby in 2012, my life has enhanced tremendously. The vibe, culture, and sport is unmatched. The people are so inviting, and it is a global game. You meet people from all over the world, from all walks of life. Rugby is my first passion and I love it. Check out my <a href="C:\Users\PHOS4\PycharmProjects\HTML-projects\files\Rugby Resume (2020).DOCX" target="_blank">Rugby CV</a> if you're interested.</p>
        <h2>Fraternity</h2>
            <p>When in college, me and 5 other individuals started a new Chapter of a fraternity. Pledging with <a href="https://phideltapsifraternity.org/" target="_blank">Phi Delta Psi Fraternity Inc</a> tested me in many ways, but what I truly cherish about it is it gave me the confidence to be comfortable with myself around people that look like me who are not in my biological family.</p>
            <p>Our motto: "All that we put in the lives of others comes back into our own."</p>
